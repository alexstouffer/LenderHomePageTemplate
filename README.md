# LenderHomePageTemplate
I converted a template from bootstrap version 2 to version 3. The use of the span class is removed and replaced with grid columns that change according to viewport width. This product was deployed using one click publishing in Visual Studio on a private server, for a client interested in HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.
